# LITE Flow tool

This project is an attempt at a reference implementation of the cryptographic
"flow" demonstrating how data undergoes encryption and signing from an embedded
device to the cloud.

In order to gather some meaningful benchmarks, there is also a main program that
is able to run on some embedded targets to benchmark this encryption.
